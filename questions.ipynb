    "# TicketSwap Interview Questions: Machine Learning Engineering Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working with a project which contains three simplified files of actual code: `cli.py`, `src/etl.py`, and `src/gradidentboost.py`. The provided code is non-functional and is not expected to be executed. Despite having comments, their accuracy is not guaranteed. This exercise is designed to mimic the experience of working with real-world code, including all its potential complexities and issues. Your task will involve a debugging and code review session based on this code, accompanied by relevant context related to the machine learning problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Context:\n",
    "This scenario represents a somewhat extreme case rather than a typical project. You'll be dealing with legacy code, possibly written under constraints of time or expertise, giving you a glimpse into the challenges of inheriting and improving upon existing work. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario Overview:\n",
    "As the newly appointed machine learning engineer, you are tasked with identifying and fixing issues within the \"Seller Fraud Detector\" system. This is your first encounter with the model, and its internal workings are unknown to you. However, you are provided with essential details on how the model operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model's function is to assess __individual transaction records__ (each representing a ticket sale) and predict the likelihood of fraudulent activity.\n",
    "* It is trained on a dataset comprising past transactions, each labeled as `0` (legitimate) or `1` (fraudulent), focusing on the most recent year's data (you don't have access to).\n",
    "* To maintain its relevance, the model undergoes daily retraining using the latest available data.\n",
    "* Input variables include an extensive range of indicators derived from user information, the payment processing system, and the details of the item being sold.\n",
    "* Fraudulent transactions are expected to constitute approximately 0.1% of all transactions.\n",
    "* The data labeling process is supported by our dedicated fraud team. You can assume for this exercise that all transactions are correctly labeled.\n",
    "* When fraud is discovered the fraud team will __mark all transactions associated with the user accounts as fraudulent__. Again, you can assume for this exercise that all transactions are correctly labeled.\n",
    "* Transactions flagged by the model as potentially fraudulent are temporarily suspended for further examination by the fraud team, who then confirm or refute the fraud suspicion.\n",
    "* The fraud team also has the authority to identify transactions as fraudulent independently of the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to address a significant discrepancy observed in the model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training and testing phases indicate that the model is effectively learning from the data, as evidenced by decreasing both training and validation loss curves over successive epochs.\n",
    "* However, a critical problem emerges when evaluating the model's real-world effectiveness: it fails to identify fraudulent transactions proactively, only recognizing them post-detection by other means. \n",
    "* Consequently, its success rate significantly lags behind the expectations set by test data performance.\n"

    "## Question 1: Identifying and Resolving the Machine Learning Bug\n",
    "In this exercise, your task is to sift through the provided codebase to identify and address any bugs that directly impact the issue at hand. While you may encounter multiple errors or inefficiencies within the code, focus specifically on those that contribute to the overarching problem. It is not necessary to overhaul the entire codebase and don't make changes directly to any files outside of this notebook. Instead, isolate the problematic code segments (methods or functions), copy them into this notebook, and apply your fixes directly to these areas. You are encouraged to use markdown cells or inline comments within the notebook to clarify the identified issues and your rationale behind the fixes. Feel free to utilize as many code or markdown cells as necessary to document your solution process.  Ensure all your findings and corrections are consolidated within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commentary on Your Solution:\n",
    "* Prioritization: Emphasize the problem(s) that most significantly affect the debugging objectives. Correct at most 2 issues in the code base and please prioritize the one(s) that are directly impeding the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bug Impact Analysis: Explain how the bug(s) you've identified play a role in the larger issue you've been tasked with debugging. Detail the specific ways in which these bugs are hindering the model's performance or accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging Strategy: Share your thought process behind the debugging strategy. Discuss how you pinpointed the problematic sections of the code and what led you to focus on those areas. Highlight any particular signs, patterns, or instincts that guided your search for the bug(s)."

    "## Question 2: Pursuing Improvement\n",
    "After successfully resolving the initial bugs, the model now mirrors its validation performance in production, notably improving its detection of first-time fraud. Despite these advancements, stakeholders desire further enhancement in the model's effectiveness. In this context, consider proposing an alternative model or approach aimed at elevating the fraud detector's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commentary on Your Proposal:\n",
    "* Suggested Model/Approach: Introduce an alternative model or strategy you believe could significantly improve the fraud detection system. \n",

    "## Question 3: Improving the GradientBoostModel Class\n",
    "#### Enhancing Code Quality: Design Principles and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "After securing stakeholder buy-in for your new modeling approach, you aim to repurpose as much existing code as possible. The existing code, especially within the `gradientboost.py` file's `GradientBoostModel` class, presents significant readability and maintainability issues. To avoid repeating these mistakes and to enhance the overall quality of your codebase, it's crucial to apply sound design principles and best practices.\n",
